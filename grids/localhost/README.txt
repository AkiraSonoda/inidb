This directory contains some basic configurations needed to run a full grid on a single machine.
Only needed for testing purposes.

Everything is untested and therefore not recommended for general use. If you are interested into OpenSimulator, please refer to:

The installation will be like this:

/home/opensim/opensimGrid - the R.O.B.U.S.T server
/home/opensim/opensimRegion - a Region in the grid

CacheDirectory=/home/opensim/cache/opensimRegion/assetcache # Flotsame Cache

Databases:

opensim_server - the databases used by R.O.B.U.S.T 
opensim_region - the databases used by the region

Thank you
